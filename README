Proof-of-Learning (PoL) AI Framework

Decentralized AI training & validation network powered by blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML).
Purely decentralized AI training framework would allow machine learning models to evolve in a transparent, verifiable, and community-driven manner without
requiring centralized control. Traditional AI development relies on private datasets, corporate oversight, and opaque decision-making, 
lacking public verifiability and fair incentive structures.
